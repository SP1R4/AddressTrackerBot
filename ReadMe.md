## Setup

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SP1R4/AddressTrackerBot.git
   cd AddressTrackerBot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Setup Configuration**

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following content:

     ```plaintext
     TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
     INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id
     ```

   Replace `your_telegram_bot_token` with your Telegram bot token and `your_infura_project_id` with your Infura project ID.

4. **Create and Initialize Files**

   - **addresses.json**: This file will be automatically created when addresses are added. You can start with an empty file:

     ```json
     {}
     ```

   - **users.json**: This file should contain a list of allowed users in JSON format. Hereâ€™s an example structure:

     ```json
     {
       "users": [
         {
           "username": "exampleuser",
           "chat_id": 123456789
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

### Running the Bot

To start the bot, simply run:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Commands

- **/start**: Displays a welcome message and available commands.
